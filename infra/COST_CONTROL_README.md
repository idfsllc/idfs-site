# AWS Cost Control System - Hard Cap Protection

## üö® **CRITICAL: Hard Cost Cap at $20/Month**

This Terraform configuration includes **automatic service shutdown** to prevent runaway AWS costs. Your services will be **automatically disabled** if monthly costs exceed $20.

## üìä **Cost Monitoring System**

### **Alert Thresholds:**
- **$8/month (80%)** - First warning email
- **$10/month (100%)** - Critical warning email  
- **$20/month (200%)** - **EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN** - All services disabled

### **Daily Monitoring:**
- Cost monitoring runs **every 24 hours**
- Checks current month's AWS spending
- Compares against thresholds
- Sends email alerts and takes action

## üîß **What Gets Disabled at $20 (Business-Friendly):**

### **Automatic Actions:**
1. **Contact Form Lambda** - Disabled (concurrency set to 0)
2. **Contact OPTIONS Lambda** - Disabled
3. **CloudFront Distribution** - ‚úÖ **REMAINS ACTIVE** (website stays up)
4. **S3 Bucket** - ‚úÖ **REMAINS ACTIVE** (website content accessible)
5. **API Gateway** - ‚úÖ **REMAINS ACTIVE** (just Lambda functions disabled)

### **Business Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Website stays online** - No DNS changes needed
- ‚úÖ **All pages accessible** - Capabilities, industries, contact page
- ‚ùå **Contact form disabled** - Visitors can't submit forms
- ‚úÖ **No downtime** - Business continues operating

### **Email Notifications:**
- Alert emails sent to your configured email address
- Business-friendly shutdown notification
- Cost breakdown by service

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**

### **Data Safety:**
- **S3 buckets are NOT deleted** - your website files are preserved
- Only **service execution** is disabled
- You can **re-enable services** after addressing cost issues

### **Re-enabling Contact Form:**
After cost control is triggered, you'll need to:
1. **Investigate** what caused high costs
2. **Fix** the underlying issue
3. **Re-enable contact form** by running:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
4. **No DNS changes needed** - website stays online throughout

### **Cost Optimization Features:**
- Lambda memory reduced to 128MB
- CloudWatch logs retention: 7-14 days
- No provisioned concurrency
- Optimized resource configurations

## üìß **Email Alerts:**

You'll receive emails at these thresholds:
- **$8** - "Cost Alert: Approaching budget limit"
- **$10** - "Cost Alert: Budget exceeded" 
- **$20** - "BUSINESS ALERT: Contact form disabled - Website remains accessible"

## üîç **Monitoring Your Costs:**

### **AWS Console:**
1. Go to **AWS Billing Dashboard**
2. Check **Cost Explorer**
3. Monitor **Budgets** section

### **Expected Monthly Costs:**
- **S3 Storage**: ~$0.50-1.00
- **CloudFront**: ~$1.00-3.00  
- **Lambda**: ~$0.50-2.00
- **API Gateway**: ~$0.50-1.00
- **SES**: ~$0.10-0.50
- **Total Expected**: **$3-8/month**

## üö® **Emergency Procedures:**

### **If Contact Form Is Disabled:**
1. **Check your email** for cost alert notification
2. **Review AWS Billing** for cost breakdown
3. **Identify** the high-cost service
4. **Fix** the issue (e.g., remove unused resources)
5. **Re-run** `terraform apply` to restore contact form
6. **Website remains online** throughout the process

### **Manual Override:**
If you need to manually disable cost monitoring:
```bash
# Disable the cost monitor Lambda
aws lambda put-function-concurrency \
  --function-name idfs-cost-monitor \
  --reserved-concurrency-limit 0
```

## üìã **Cost Control Files:**

- `cost_controls.tf` - Budget alerts and monitoring
- `hard_cost_cap.tf` - Automatic shutdown system
- `iam_cost_management.tf` - Required permissions

## ‚úÖ **Peace of Mind:**

With this system, you can deploy your public website knowing that:
- ‚úÖ **Costs won't exceed $20/month**
- ‚úÖ **You'll get early warnings at $8 and $10**
- ‚úÖ **Your website stays online** - no DNS changes needed
- ‚úÖ **Only contact form disabled** - business continues operating
- ‚úÖ **Easy recovery** - just run `terraform apply`

**Your business website is now protected against runaway costs while staying online!** üõ°Ô∏è
